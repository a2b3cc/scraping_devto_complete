This has nothing to do with whether or not you can make a living through Fiverr but it is because people who know nothing about software development and web design pricing think that this work should be easy for us and thus should be paid cheaply. We as developers have to make a stand by not caving to low ballers simply because we may just need the money. Clients need to understand that good work requires plenty of time and a decent pay. Unfortunately, many devs outside of the US charge way too cheaply for these services, thus lowering expectations of pricing.', 'There‚Äôs another way to look at it: view Fiverr et al as acquisition channels. Having seen the ‚Äúbuying‚Äù side as well, the race to the bottom not only applies to prices but also quality, unfortunately. Whenever we contract someone from these platforms, we have to go through smaller projects since few people are willing to do an interview upfront. As Kyle pointed out, one small deal can lead to much bigger gigs and happy relationships and all you need to do is let quality shine through.', 'Exactly, Arne :) thanks for understanding it in context', 'I totally agree', 'Thanks for your opinion, Oziel :)', ""How much would you charge? (I would appreciate having examples including the position, language and experience if you could give)\nI haven't landed my first job yet."", ""Assuming you live in the US, it depends on the project. If it's a small static website (3 - 7 pages with no blog template), then the minimum I would charge is $500, especially if it's Wordpress; if you are a more experienced designer and can dish out a really good looking website, then you should be charging $800 - $1200, especially if there are a lot of unique pages (like landing pages) and if you are integrating a back end language for templating or for access to a database for storing a bit of data; high end websites could be $1400 to $2000. Then as you get in to the realm of e-commerce or large blogs, you have to start charging a minimum of $1000 but more like $1400 to $5000 depending on how big the business is (small shops would be in the lower range and large corporations would be charged that big price)."", ""Speaking of e-commerce, we should now mention web and mobile apps. If you are doing those types of projects, it's actually better to charge hourly because those projects can last 3 to 6 months, so you want to be compensated fairly for that. Junior devs would be charged $16 - $22/ hour, mid level would be like $24 - $30, and seniors would be $32 and above. In some projects, you could do a contract of a base fee like $1200 for a web app, plus an hourly rate for anything that's outside the scope of the work (think deployment, testing, making changes to work that's already been done, etc.)."", ""Of course these are my opinions on pricing so each developer's rates will differ. For the average stack of technologies like Python, JavaScript, PHP, the usual databases like MySQL or SQLite, you would refer to the rates I mentioned, but for more enterprise-level technologies like Java, .NET, SQL Server, you would charge a bit more.

Most places don't ask this to test if you have advanced algorithm knowledge. They do this, to see how you can map a problem, turn it into code with a simple solution (the brute force solution), test it, and potentially optimize it. This, second part is something that most people would fail without preparation upfront - preparation that will be useful for the rest of your career, I would add. I would not go deeper than the topics Emma listed: but, I would go deep into them and master these tools. So e.g. being able to implement a BFS or DFS (breadth-first-search or depth-first-search) is something almost all places will expect people to be able to write working code for, if asked. BFS and DFS is especially true for Google, where trees and graphs are a bit of the DNA of the company."", 'Thanks again for this great overview!', ""I always wonder why data structures/algorithms is a necessity for almost all places...if you need them, you read/learn/use them. I don't feel any less of a programmer not being able to implement them in minutes, except for the brute force ü§ì"", ""I think you misunderstand what I meant by you need to know data structures and algorithms. Where I work, we don't ask you to implement any of these on interviews (some companies do ask this - though a lot more are turning into more practical problems). You need to know them, to be able to solve the type of coding problems that can be understood in 5 minutes and solved in 45 minutes with no framework dependencies. So things testing your problem-solving skills. Though when I learned about them, I implemented them for fun - as they're all pretty simple ones, and it's a fun little challenge to do so."", ""For places like Google and the like, to pass the interview process, you most likely need to prepare for these - become familiar with how the structures work, cases where they are good solutions, and if you're curious, looking into real-world examples where they are used (e.g. do you know what tree structure is a very popular to use for SQL database indexing and why? It's interesting to learn why and how)."", ""Not knowing these doesn't make you a worse programmer. But you'd probably do worse on the interview than the many other candidates you're competing for that same position at these places where it's competitive to get through each of the rounds, and then getting an offer."", 'I see, but one thing is still not clear.', 'What is the extra information an interviewer gets from the candidate if he/she solves a problem with this lexical knowledge or another one where this knowledge is not needed?', 'I think the main point comes from showing you know something that is easily testable (as algorithms and compleity analysis surely are) for your interviewers, you know?', 'The point, IMO, is not that you have to know them by heart because that is a skill you gotta know at any given moment. It is the process of learning and the growth that comes from it, and the specific areas of your reasoning those subjects encompass, that they should be trying to test.', ""In other words, as one of my teachers in primary school used to say: we are not here to teach you History or Mathematics or Chemistry, you're not gonna need all that. We are teaching you how to think, and each one of us [professors] is doing it the way he/she knows best."", 'Wonderful comment Gergely! Thank you!', 'One of the main cornerstones, that later dictates the success of the company, is the hiring and ultimately the people you let in. Many of the companies focus all the resources just to get max profit in production, not focusing enough on step one. Google and other large companies know that, so they invest a lot of money to really filter the best.', 'With that being said, this would also be a nice insight for people looking to start their businesses or managers looking to improve their hiring process. Nice read, Emma :)', 'IMO', 'Getting only the best of the best of the best with honors leads to a lot of frustration when the ultimate masters of coding have to do the basic grunt work that is 95% of real coding work.', 'Also having people jump through multiple hoops in their free time is also not a very compelling proposition for a lot of developers.

Transpilation is a style of compilation that translates code from one language into another. In typescript that's theoretically really simple because it is a superset of JavaScript. Presumably if you remove all type information from the typescript file, it could be run like a normal JavaScript file. This is not exactly the case, but you get the difference with a language like C that gets compiled into machine code.

Sometimes the best intros are by those who are new to something. Good job with your post.', 'For some more insights into why sigmoid functions for activation units.... First, there are others that are more commonly used now as you pointed out such as ReLU units. But for a very long time, the sigmoid was the preferred unit. It has some connections in statistics (e.g. cumulative distribution functions). But it also has some useful properties.', ""One of those useful properties is that when the weights are small and the weighted sum of inputs is near 0 the sigmoid is approximately linear. It becomes more non-linear as weights are further from 0. Why is this useful? The simpler the model that fits the data is generally preferred. The more non-linear, the greater the risk of overfitting the training data. Early in training process weights are nearer to 0 (initialized to be near 0) than they are later in training. So neural network tends to become more non-linear the longer you train. This is why you also need to use cross validation or some other validation approach to ensure you don't overtrain. Essentially, model gets increasingly non-linear over time, sort of like simpler model to more complex."", 'Another more basic reason for sigmoid is the common use of neural networks for classification. The range of output from 0 to 1 fits naturally to binary decisions (yes/no, 0/1, etc). Or to probabilistic decisions if you interpret the output as a probability (e.g. ouput of 0.8 means that there is a probability of 0.8 that the input is an X for whatever X you are trying to classify).', 'During the long period of time when the benefits of deep learning were not yet fully seen, there are also some classic theoretical results that rely on sigmoids:', 'Those results suggest that you need at most 3 hidden layers. And the more layers you have the longer training takes and the more training data you need. So for a long time deep learning was seen as impractical (e.g. not enough processor speed and data).', 'Now that deep learning is more practical than it was in the past due to availability of much larger data sets as well as many core systems, GPUs, VPUs, etc, those results are less important, and other activation functions have grown in use for a variety of reasons.', 'Thanks for the extensive write up and extra info, that was super interesting and really informative. üôèüèºüíó', ""You're welcome.

In theory we have a lot of flexibility because of the compiler/code generation, but there is definitely custom work to be done for each new stack/lang/architecture.

This is actually how we initially thought about it, too, so we presented it as a DSL. But from building and talking to people, we figured out that calling it a framework makes it much more straightforward for developers since that is the role/function that Wasp essentially fulfills. It would also fall in a category of meta-frameworks, like e.g. Next/Astro, which are frameworks that make use of other libs/frameworks such as React.', ""For me Next is not a meta-framework because the hard coupling with React.

The CLists are focused on small and theoretical stuff. Huge missed opportunity in my book. And I did my PhD in language stuff."", ""I completely understand where you're coming from - we did a lot of research on other attempts at this and concluded the same.

But the idea itself has definitely been floating around for the last few decades."", 'Good on \'ya for having studied the literature. Yeah I think it\'s all about incentives. The academics are in the business of cranking out papers, which boils out to justifying their next round of funding. The frameworks they do develop are just means to that end. The shear effort it takes to gain broad acceptance - which you\'ve explained well - has no payoff for them. The clinker is that many (most?) academic grants are focused on sustaining research efforts for their own sake, without paying enough attention to practical impact. They throw the community development task over the wall and hope someone else picks it up, which seldom happens. The main mechanism I see is ""doing a startup"" to hawk an academic idea as a product. But that is way too big a leap for diffuse concepts like languages that solve problems of distributed applications.', 'Well put!', ""I'm really glad I found WASP, I've been exploring it for the past 2 months and what you guys are doing is simply amazing.

And as I progressed along, being in awe for a good part of it, I got to a point where it all blew up. So, I am updating a screen and I see that the info is not rendered in the edit box. And I mention that to the 'copilot'. And what it does it makes it that the information is now retrieved from the back end every nano second or so. And this for one user. So in case of thousands of users the backend would have been overwhelmed with requests. So much for 'vibe coding'. But don't get me wrong, I think 'vibe coding' is great for prototypes and one off or great helpers in case I am stuck. But if I do not know what I am doing it is just going to generate AI slop. No better example than this: Cybernews did research on hundreds of thousands of apps in the App Store and they discovered that a a great amount of them are badly handling the secrets (passwords, keys, logins and so on).

The focus is too much that new technology - that is available to a minority - equates to progress.

I would argue that 99.9% of humans never produce anything ""new"". We use prior knowledge (prior computation) in order to create something.

AutoGen is very much alive, very much still being invested in and maintained by a growing team at MSFT from across multiple divisions, is underlying agent systems in multiple 1p products including many announced yesterday, and yes will be converging with Semantic Kernel to offer a unified, scalable, distributed, xlang, standards based agent runtime. We are continuing to maintain the 0.2 branch but new features will show up in main. The differentiation for SK is around support, not stability, scale, etc.', 'Thanks for clarification! Quick question, would the below be an accurate update?', '...', 'Maintained by Community and Microsoft (moving to community only support in early 2025)\n...', 'Legacy Autogen 0.2', 'Maintained by Community', ""Not exactly.\nAutoGen 0.4 - new event-driven actor model architecture, designed for scale, resilience, flexibility, forward looking feature development, driven by customer and community feedback, support x-lang agent communication, will be supported in Semantic Kernel as well. Built by dedicated teams at MSFT, continuing and growing investment, used in multiple MSFT products and services (not moving to maintained by community - not sure where that's coming from)"", 'Semantic Kernel - a general purpose AI application SDK that will take a dependency on the Autogen runtime for multi agent. You can seek enterprise support for SK.', 'AutoGen 0.2 - the previous autogen arch, constrained to chat scenarios, synchronous, not scalable. still maintained by msft, but no new feature dev.', 'AG2 - unrelated to MSFT fork of autogen 0.2 made by a former employee - no significant new features or company behind it.', ""In your original comment you touched the question of support, Community vs Microsoft - that's where I can see possible inaccuracy. Any other parts? The rest of your comments seem to be expanding of what is already in the post, focusing on the MSFT side."", ""To be clear, I am not taking sides. There're currently 2 almost identical products: AG2 and AutoGen 0.2. And there's a lot of confusion due to uncoordinated and challenging split. There's no purpose (in my post) to make comparisons and tell how various derivatives/branches/variants of AutoGen are different - those interested can follow the links."", 'I just want to make it clear that Microsoft is going to continue to invest in (and grow) its investment in autogen 0.4, and is still involved in maintaining Autogen 0.2 - ""community maintainance"" implies it being abandoned, which is not the case. The distinction with SK is around Commercial Support, which is a feature available with SK.', 'and yes, uncoordinated and challenging are accurate in that the former employee is unilaterally implying that they are the official autogen project from Microsoft when it could have been easy to signal that it was indeed a distinct project.', 'My experience from last year/early this year (when I contributed to Autogen) was such that community (including independent contributors such as myself) drove a significant portion of changes, if not the major part. Folks from MS (as far as I remember) did extra mile.', 'Autogen might be one of a few OS projects that did see a lot of development from contributors not employed/assigned by companies sponsoring the development.', '""Maintained by community"" seemed to work fine (with the exception of, my personal opinion, code base becoming disorganised and not developer friendly). I suppose the momentum is still there and community support doesn\'t mean abandoned...', 'I see - so we were just each getting different meaning out of those words.\nIn the end the thing I wanted to land is that absent the confusion created by the announcement the project is going from strength to strength - there are plenty of msft teams that are really invested in it now and that guarantees a certain amount of ongoing growth and evolution, which we are excited about. The way in which the ""AG2"" project was announced seems intended to create doubt and FUD and that\'s too bad because the opportunity to contribute and work together has always been there, as you have observed. Looking forward to working with you on it further!', 'Hi I am second author of the AutoGen paper and a MSFT FTE -- AG2 is branched by a subset of the initial ""creators"". I\'ve personally refrained from using such exclusionary language because from the very beginning the project has been very collaborative and used feedback/ideas from many many people and prior work. Many MSFT researchers and interns have worked on this project since 2023 and only one FTE since then has left the team to pursue other opportunities. It would be great if you can clarify your post.', 'What clarification do you propose?', ""Here's how Andrew Ng's newsletter described it."", 'deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-281/', '""In late 2024, part of the Autogen team split off to build AG2 based on a fork of the code base.""', 'This is accurate and doesn\'t minimize the contributions of many many folks, unlike ""AG2 branched out by original creators"".', 'Well-structured and detailed explanation of the current state of Autogen and its evolution into multiple iterations and projects. The breakdown of the four key versions and their respective links is especially helpful in navigating a complex topic.

And what are some of the things you suggest to craft a great profile?"", ""Best idea to stand out is building side projects if you don't have any prior work. If you show proof of work, then you are more likely to get hired with no experience.\nRegarding the profile apart of the tips I wrote in the article, I recommend you find couple highly rated freelancer profiles in your area of expertise ( or area you aspire to be expert in ), and take inspiration from that. When I was doing my profile at the start I just copied what I saw and liked in profiles of other freelancers, and changed it up to give it my personal twist.\nYou should put most focus into building your portfolio with some side-projects, because this is what will help you stand out the most."", 'cool!

If the job were to write a web crawler in Python, what would be the most common way of sending the crawler to the client? Do they expect a package installable with pip?"", ""Hey, good question. It will depend on a client, some clients will just want the crawled data delivered and don't care for the script, some clients will require a python files, for others it doesn't matter, in those cases I usually make the crawler an executable, or attach short instruction how to install python and packages to run it since its simple enough.""]"

The only difference being that now you could write everything in one language and use source includes then recompile everything together where Python libs written for a specific platform ""cannot"" do this because they pre-compiled for single platform.

In this case, if swallow is inspired by Python, it also seems great to me, a language that is compiled, without GC, with auto-free and has the advantages that Python has, would be magnificent.

As text clearly points out is that you may now be able to avoid Python libraries written in other languages for speed and then having interface to Python and instead simply have libraries fully written in same language as the code you\'re writing yourself. Point being you can write Python application and move it\'s code anyplace without thinking about platform unless you depend on such libraries. If swallow will have to be compiled each time for platform then it looses that perspective. Note that not all Python apps are written to use AI stuff or something depending on heavy calculations so they don\'t care about this and enjoy ""write once move anywhere"" to some extent. Again not saying it\'s preventable in all cases but if you completely loose that part of the Python then you loose specific group of devs.']"

Coming from Java, it‚Äôs difficult for me to adjust to such simplicity, and I feel the same about JavaScript.\nThat said, Python hasn‚Äôt ""spoiled"" me yet.

Our main framework will be react, but I want the possibility to migrate away from it step by step, without having to re-write the whole application from scratch. Our current monolithic frontend is written in AngularJS and since we are still a very small team, with a huge application, migrating away from AngularJS for us currently would mean no new feature releases in the current frontend, while rewriting everything in the new framework. And we don't want that to happen to us again in the future, so that if for some reason react would be deprecated, we can update each micro-frontend on it's own. That is actually an approach I want to try now with our current monolith. My current plan is to integrate the AngularJS monolith into the micro-frontend architecture and then gradually replace different parts of the application.

This has nothing to do with whether or not you can make a living through Fiverr but it is because people who know nothing about software development and web design pricing think that this work should be easy for us and thus should be paid cheaply. We as developers have to make a stand by not caving to low ballers simply because we may just need the money. Clients need to understand that good work requires plenty of time and a decent pay. Unfortunately, many devs outside of the US charge way too cheaply for these services, thus lowering expectations of pricing.', 'There‚Äôs another way to look at it: view Fiverr et al as acquisition channels. Having seen the ‚Äúbuying‚Äù side as well, the race to the bottom not only applies to prices but also quality, unfortunately. Whenever we contract someone from these platforms, we have to go through smaller projects since few people are willing to do an interview upfront. As Kyle pointed out, one small deal can lead to much bigger gigs and happy relationships and all you need to do is let quality shine through.', 'Exactly, Arne :) thanks for understanding it in context', 'I totally agree', 'Thanks for your opinion, Oziel :)', ""How much would you charge? (I would appreciate having examples including the position, language and experience if you could give)\nI haven't landed my first job yet."", ""Assuming you live in the US, it depends on the project. If it's a small static website (3 - 7 pages with no blog template), then the minimum I would charge is $500, especially if it's Wordpress; if you are a more experienced designer and can dish out a really good looking website, then you should be charging $800 - $1200, especially if there are a lot of unique pages (like landing pages) and if you are integrating a back end language for templating or for access to a database for storing a bit of data; high end websites could be $1400 to $2000. Then as you get in to the realm of e-commerce or large blogs, you have to start charging a minimum of $1000 but more like $1400 to $5000 depending on how big the business is (small shops would be in the lower range and large corporations would be charged that big price)."", ""Speaking of e-commerce, we should now mention web and mobile apps. If you are doing those types of projects, it's actually better to charge hourly because those projects can last 3 to 6 months, so you want to be compensated fairly for that. Junior devs would be charged $16 - $22/ hour, mid level would be like $24 - $30, and seniors would be $32 and above. In some projects, you could do a contract of a base fee like $1200 for a web app, plus an hourly rate for anything that's outside the scope of the work (think deployment, testing, making changes to work that's already been done, etc.)."", ""Of course these are my opinions on pricing so each developer's rates will differ. For the average stack of technologies like Python, JavaScript, PHP, the usual databases like MySQL or SQLite, you would refer to the rates I mentioned, but for more enterprise-level technologies like Java, .NET, SQL Server, you would charge a bit more. If you know rare stuff like COBOL or similar legacy tech, you could charge serious cash because there's not as many developers out there that know those skills and many government agencies and corporations still rely on that."", 'Thank you for the detailed explanation!', 'Sign up on RemoteMore, they have a remote salary calculator.', 'It tells you how much others with a similar background to yours charge in remote developer jobs.', ""Excellent list!

So for anyone else reading the article and my comment here: there's a small problem with the useFetch hook implementation."", ""It currently would not react to URL or options argument changes, since the internally used useEffect doesn't specify them as dependencies, so the response result wouldn't change should the request change (e.g. different URL or different query parameters). In fact fetch only runs once on component mount, because the dependencies array is empty."", 'In order to fix that the url and the options need to be added to the dependencies array as follows:', 'The problem with React dependencies is that changes are detected through referential equality tests. So a hook with dependencies only gets re-run when the following is true for one or more of the dependency values:', 'That works fine for primitive values such as numbers, strings and booleans.', 'In case of functions or objects such as the options parameter this is a bit of a problem. Even when the data in an object literal does not change, two instances of {} are not referentially equal. JavaScript would create new instances for those object literals on each render run.', 'Three workarounds for that:', 'Let the user of useFetch take care of memoizing the options via useMemo, so it\'s ""referentially stable"" and does not change from render run to render run. But that would be sorting out the problem from the wrong end in my opinion', ""From within useFetch, serialize the options argument as string, and add that string to the dependencies array. The serialization must be stable though, so we don't get different results between render runs (i.e. different order of properties)"", ""Use an use effect hook that is able to do deep dependency comparisons. Let's call it useEffectDeep. That could be either an exercise for writing another custom hook, or can be downloaded from here (or other places): github.com/kentcdodds/use-deep-com..."", 'Awesome, thank you very much for the detailed analysis!', 'üî•üî•', 'Great to see you are embracing the hook feature! And awesome you share your findings.', 'There are however a few small problems with your hooks.', 'You are storing the callback into a ref which is great because you make sure you will allways call the latest version. You however set it using useEffect. This means if the callback changes, the change will be picked up in the next frame. Theoretically there is a chance that the callback has changed when the timeout (or interval) fires. You can fix it like this:', ""This might actually be expected behavior, but this does not actually show the previous 'different' value. If you component rendered again with no value change usePrevious would return the same value. So the actual name should be useValueFromPreviousRender."", 'You could see this behavior when you add another state to the MoneyCount component that toggles a boolean when you click another button. The hook would be a bit more involved if you wanted to show the previous value after a change.', 'This hook adds and removes the event listener on each render. It would be smart to use a similar strategy to useTimeout with a ref for the callback. On top of that, its a good idea to set the dependency array.', 'As a side note: in theory the ref you are given could be a function ref, if that is the case your code would fail. The easiest way to guard for this is by creating and returning the ref from the hook itself.', 'I think this is already mentioned but it only executes once during the lifetime of the component.', 'In real world applications you often want to know the response status code. I think it would be a great addition to add that.', 'These hooks capture the callback that is passed in. This means that if the callback changes, those changes will not be picked up. For useComponentDidMount this will most likely never cause a problem, for useComponentDidUnmount I can see this causing problems more often.', 'If someone in my company would create these hooks I would say that these hooks do not have the correct name. Their names refer to the component lifecycle and that is something hooks helps us to move away from. We want to focus on the actual effect and its lifecycle. On top of that, for new developers (that have only been exposed to React with hooks) the concepts of mount and unmount are unknown.', 'All in all great examples. I hope my comments are of value to you. I strongly suggest you install the eslint plugin as this would warn you for most problems.', 'Nice comment! But I have a puzzle: why borther to use', 'I think we can eliminate the use of useRef, just use the callback argument in the place callbackRef.current.', '@wangyouhua Great question: What is the difference between these versions?', 'You can see the difference in the usage, in this example I want to log the value of someState after 5 seconds:', 'As you can see version 2 and 3 have a bit different behavior. Version 2 is broken (and caught by the linting rules). Version 3 has unexpected behavior, it resets the timeout when someState is changed.', ""This has to with the 'capturing' of the callback. Once you pass a function to setTimeout that function can not be changed. Primitive values it references are captured. In order to get the expected result and don't put the burden of that correct handling on the user of the hook, we keep a reference to the 'current' callback."", 'So if you are using callbacks in hooks this is a great pattern:', 'Thank you very much for this detailed comment, this helps a lot!', ""blog.post.replace(/pictures/gi, 'code'));"", 'I think I would break the loading out of res.response in useFetch().\nWhy? Because if you load something else (a different URL), then res.response already exists and won\'t cause the ""loading..."" to be shown... so the loading flag really needs to be before the start of fetch() and after setData()', '', ""useComponentWillUnmount this way (in the image), then won't it be true if the component is rendered 20 times, then useEffect() sets it up 20 times to run it 20 times? That's because you are calling useEffect() 20 times in total"", '', ""Hi, I enjoyed reading this. I didn't find use cases for all of them in a recent project. I'm using a Mediator pattern to handle fetch requests. I did repeat my self !DRY. But the abstraction is a refactor for another iteration."", ""I do agree with the comments which point out the errors. I would suggest making the fixes and updating this article. There's an option which allows you to do that."", ""And if you haven't already done so. Check out React Server Components.

Strangely most seems fine with it. Developers should bring revolting change as I believe most of our work can be automated or handled automatically.', ""Did you try the latest Laravel on PHP 8.1 and Octane?

The fact that you're here trying to argue that one shouldn't bother learning a tool that has proven to be resourceful for many applications says a lot about your lack of willingness to cooperate with other devs on their choices. One thing you should focus on is open-mindedness as newer tools in the future will replace JS and phase out that tech stack, even if that means switching back to older technology. Also, think about learning to communicate well so that you can succeed in working with teams. Spouting comments to get people to agree with you won't get you anywhere"", 'True this post is about JS Full Stack but the argument is valid that you should promote other programming languages and not just stick to JS. That\'s the main problem. JS is a crippling language. It doesn\'t do much to teach you about OOP or good programming techniques. You can get better mileage with PHP or Java or even Go. In other words, don\'t tell others that you should just ""settle"" for one thing; there\'s many other tools and languages to explore that can be useful for certain use cases. Node.js for example is single threaded, doing async operations using the event loop, whereas you can get better async performance with something like Go routines or even Kotlin coroutines. PHP is now more powerful than JS and should definitely be promoted above JS for certain use cases, where as other things like maybe WebSockets is where JS shines above PHP. Again the point is, definitely promote PHP or any other language without hating on JS as all have their pros and cons.', ""And as for Cobol, well, you'd be surprised to see what you can still do with Cobol nowadays.

Also take note that all the server side rendering that has become famous with React and Vue are all native to PHP since forever. In fact, a lot of development patterns today in nodejs are already present in PHP a long time ago. PHP is still much a straightforward language for the web.

I agree this should definitely be a must-read for anyone working with React', 'I would like to point out a few improvements to the examples.', ""I would strongly discourage the use of IIFE. It's too easy to miss while reading the code and you don't really get much benefits from them anymore."", ""Readability is better than performance unless performance is absolutely required. In my career, I've come across maybe 2 situations where performance needed to trump readability."", ""While it's pretty nice to abstract the logic for a provider outside the actual component code, I believe your example shows the wrong abstraction. A custom hook (#63) would have been more appropriate here."", 'The problem with ""self-contained context provider"" components is they are harder to use in tests. We embed logic in the self-contained function that needs to be mocked for a lot of tests depending on the values in the context. It\'s easier to keep your context provider ""raw"" and then you can simply use the same context provider in your tests and pass whatever you want for values. Still some mocking, but so much simpler that way.', 'While I fully see how easier it is with these hooks, it also trains you to manipulate an object without thinking about immutability.', ""This is a huge crutch! I've seen many developers being completely lost once they had to actually code the real thing. They didn't understand whatever principle they were replacing with these libraries, and they made a huge mess in the code base."", 'These libraries also tend to complicate the typings of your objects unnecessarily. I still have nightmares with Redux and ImmerJs, the ""cure"" was worse than the ""problem"".', 'My advice would be to avoid these kinds of libraries like the plague. They will not serve you well in your career in the long term.', 'The example is not the best. In this case, fetchData should have already been memoized before being passed to useLoadData. Doing it in the children is ""wrong"" as it will be much less efficient this way.', 'Your example shows 2 HTML elements with the same id... (input/span)', 'I recommend calling useId() once and composing your id for different components, ex:', ""Obviously, I wouldn't name them inputId and spanId, but for illustrative purpose this is fine..."", 'I agree 100% with the notion, but the example is not the best one.', 'This should be used like slots are used in web-components.', 'children is pretty much the exception and should always be used with PropsWithChildren instead. You did use it right after in #83', 'Overall, an amazing article, kudos!!!', 'Thanks for the comments @thethirdrace üòÄ.', ""8: The reason why I recommend IIFE is that I don't like it when there are variables polluting the component. Ideally, we can extract the logic into a function, but sometimes it is not the best if the logic takes so many arguments (and it is hard to find a name for the function üòÖ). My example is indeed too simple to show the problem, but I can see code like this inside a component."", 'In these cases, I am ok with someone either using IIFE or extracting the logic into a function.', '35 You are right. As pointed out, I am indeed using the hook üòÖ. Will change it to make it much clearer!', '37 So I was actually thinking like you before. But recently, I have been using the redux toolkit, and damn, the experience is so much nicer. That is why I think they are still worth exploring.', ""45 I actually disagree here. When I write code, I want to make it super easy for consumers. And if we require every consumer to memoize the function passed, it won't work every time. That is why I am using a ref here to make sure my callback doesn't change while still using the correct value of the function when called"", '66 I am using a single ID because the ID is associated with a single element: the name', '82 You are right. The example is not the best. Will change it :)', ""It's more about the syntax that is really hard to pick up for developers, mistakes are too easy to make."", ""I've seen people do some IIFE in useEffect just because they needed an async function there. But that isn't immediately obvious, and you can easily fix it with a syntax like this:"", 'As you can see, the syntax is basically the same without the IIFE that is hard to catch. We define the function normally and call it right after. Same principle, less mistakes possibilities.', ""While it may look like those 2 methods are the very same and there's no difference, there are in fact many."", 'The way people read text (western style => top->down & left->right), the IIFE will require 2 parallel contexts to load into memory, the function itself and the executing context (()()). This increase cognitive load as they need to be loaded at the same time in parallel.', ""Comparatively, by separating in 2 sections, you load those 2 contexts sequentially. You can read the whole function without worries and then you see it's called. This is already much easier to contextualize in memory because these things happen sequentially."", 'But there\'s another advantage to loading context sequentially like this. If you just want to have an idea of what the component does, you can easily see there\'s a function definition and skip to the next ""block"" without checking how the function does its work. Sequential context loading allows you to skim the code very fast without caring much about the details. This is not possible with IIFE because you need to figure out what that first parenthesis really means before closing the function context.', 'I want also to point out that the spacing is important to really delimitate the function from the return section. For the same reason we use spacing between paragraphs and after punctuation, spacing is essential to separate concepts in code.', 'These are very subtle things to take into account, but on large scale it makes your system so much more accessible and easier to work with.', ""Redux toolkit doesn't require ImmerJS to work, it's an option you can use out of the box, but not a necessity."", ""But I do get where you're coming from. It's much easier to read your state if there's a minimum amount of code."", 'I would argue it comes with a few problems though...', ""First, as mentioned in my previous post, you start to use that method everywhere because you're so used to it. Unfortunately, not all systems are built with Immer so you start to put bugs in other apps that don't use it because your brain isn't trained to see these mistakes. For your brain, all you can see is correct syntax. And the reviewers will not necessarily pick up on that because they never imagine someone would just assign the state like that because you just don't do that in their system. It's an unwritten rule for most likely 99.9% of production systems out there... The result is a bug in production, and not an obvious debug session because the coder and the review don't see the bug since their brain trick them into thinking the line is correct..."", 'Second, you lose context of your state. When you do not use Immer and rebuild the state from the ground up in your reducer, you always see the whole story. But when using Immer, you only see whatever changes without any context. This is potentially very dangerous because you might not take into account everything you should.', ""Third, if you really need Immer to clean up the code, then I would argue your piece of state is way too complicated. You should split it up or flatten it, there's too much cognitive load in that state."", 'I used to always mutate in-place until I got these nasty bugs that took hours to debug. Immer will fix it in your code, but not in your head. I would argue fixing the concept in your head is going to be much more important for you than fixing it for that particular line of code.', ""When I write code, I want to make it super easy for consumers. And if we require every consumer to memoize the function passed, it won't work every time."", 'You definitely want to make your code super easy for consumers, no argument there. But I think you misunderstood what I meant here. I meant that the fetchData needs to be stable to begin with.', ""Even if you memoize the value at the consumer level, if the parent doesn't have a stable reference, then the memoization in the consumer will re-run on render."", ""I see you used a ref to avoid the memoization re-run in the consumer. Don't get me wrong, this is a clever pattern, but it's just a band-aid. You are going to have to do this in every consumer now, and for the lifetime of the app, and all developers in your app will have to do the same, etc. The technical debt balloons very fast."", ""By having a stable reference in the parent, the problem is solved at 1 place. You won't have to add code anywhere else; you solved it once and no consumer needs to worry about it. Simplicity at its finest."", ""I would also argue that a re-render is not the end of the world either. You can squeeze every ounce of performance out of your code, but if your performance budget is not totally used at the end of the render cycle, it's thrown out. So any excess in performance you got might not be perceivable by users anyway. You prematurely optimized code that didn't even needed it, this is time that could have been spent elsewhere. We all should strive for performant apps, but at some point there are diminishing returns and it's our job to figure out when it's necessary and when it's not."", 'Also, this might not even be necessary at all now with the new React Compiler. The function will have a stable reference in the parent without requiring you to do anything about it. On the other hand, your pattern will still leave a lot of code in lots of consumers, which is less performant and less maintainable than no code at all.', ""id should be unique by element, it has nothing to do with name. It's how the HTML syntax works."", 'The span and the input should not, at any point, have the same id. Browsers will let you do it just fine, but developers will have a hard time when querying by id.', ""You should not ignore this because we're in React here. It doesn't matter, it is a bug. That's why I pointed it out."", '#8 *IIFE * ‚Äî I see your point. I am used to the syntax so that is probably why I missed that it could be hard for new devs. I will adapt it! Thanks :)', ""#37 Immer‚Äî I see your point. However, I will still leave it as a tip since it can really make life easier. I will defer to people's judgment."", ""#45 Memoize ‚Äî I am not following your reasoning. The whole point with this hook is that consumers don't have any memoization to do. I am aware that React Compiler is coming: which gives even more sense to not having memoization be done by consumers. Whether or not memoization is needed, everyone's codebase is different. I prefer to memoize hooks' returns values (like libraries do) from experience and given my situation, but obviously, everyone is free to memoize or not ;)"", '#66 ids ‚Äî Oh sorry, I missed that. You are right: ids should always be unique. Replacing it!', ""I am not following your reasoning. The whole point with this hook is that consumers don't have any memoization to do."", 'Ah I see, we simply are not focusing on the same thingüòÖ', 'The problems with the example are manyfold.', 'If you simply wanted to memoize everything, you should do this:', 'The useCallback dependency array solves all your requirements and is much simpler.', 'Instead, your ""good"" example replaced the standard dependency array method by 1 indirection (the ref) and 1 extra step for synchronization (the useEffect). Plus, now the value contained in fetchDataRef is not calculated at render, but at the useEffect phase so you added an asynchronous step to the state of your component.', ""You don't need the ref or the useEffect steps at all. The dependency array was enough to adjust the value without any extra step. As a bonus, the value is calculated at render and in a synchronous way."", ""Furthermore, the code is much simpler this way. You don't have to keep all these extra steps in your memory to understand how it works. The cognitive load is lower, and this makes it easier for people to understand the code."", 'üö® When you want to memoize a value, you need to do it when you define the variable that holds the value.', ""Given that fetchData is defined outside the hook, as it's passed by the consumer, memoizing it here doesn't have an impact on re-renders in the consumer."", ""If fetchData is defined in the consumer and you didn't memoize it at creation time, then it will be recalculated on every render of the consumer. What was the point in synchronizing the new function reference in useLoadData if you could have simply used the new function to begin with?"", 'If fetchData came from the parent of the consumer, then any state change in the parent would re-render the consumer (because the consumer is a children of the parent).', ""Your memoization in the consumer itself didn't prevent a re-render of the consumer at all in this case. Again, what was the point in using all that extra code if it's going to be re-calculated anyway?"", 'I would even ask what was the point of useMemo in useLoadData?', ""You need to execute the whole hook to know if 2 references have changed. If they did change, you are returning the 2 new references. If they didn't change, you are returning the 2 old references. In both case, you return 2 references, all the calculations have been done already and you memoized the tiniest and fastest possible data ever, so what did you save by adding so much code around it?"", ""Don't get me wrong, I think your whole article is amazing. I'm simply pointing out that you might need to revisit the memoization concepts because there's a tiny gap there. And I cannot stress enough that you get it better than 99.99% of developers, even if you have a tiny gap missing."", ""This is also why most of the time it's better not to use memoization at all. It's a very easy concept to grasp, but it's a very hard one to apply correctly. And mistakes in applying it are worse than not applying it at all."", ""So, I still think there is a misunderstanding here. I am using a ref here instead of useCallback dependencies because I explicitly don't want my callback to change, which will be the case if I use a dependencies array (all items will need to be memoized)."", 'Here, what I like in this pattern is that the entire complexity lives in this single hook.', 'Check similar implementations like in here or here for example.', ""I understand what you want to achieve, and I agree to a certain degree. If the hook didn't receive a parameter that is NOT memoized, I would be 100% behind the principle."", ""The flaw I'm pointing at is that the hook is getting a parameter that is not memoized. In turn, this has a few adverse effects..."", ""One of them is that it's most likely slower to run the useEffect to synchronise the fetchDataRef than actually redeclaring the loadData function every render. Memoizing is supposed to be used for expansive compute, this is just a function declaration so there's no expansive compute."", 'Another adverse effect is you have complexified your code a lot. Developers now have to take into account the useCallback implications AND the useEffect synching. Your code would most likely be just as fast without any memoization at all and would be much simpler. The ""bad"" example is actually good because you didn\'t mesure what you saved; you did premature optimization without an ounce of evidence.', ""The worse adverse effect is the bug probability part. When reading a useCallback with an empty dependency array, most will take for granted that nothing can change the function. But this is not true because you can change the fetchData function and fetch something completely different between 2 calls. Making a wrong assumption here can lead to many bugs down the line. Your good intention is opening the door for many possible problems because you didn't use the standard dependency array. You can't expect developers to follow uncommon patterns without making mistakes."", 'Remember, any state update of the consumer component and all its hooks will re-render the consumer and all its children. The only way to stop a re-render down the chain is to either use {children} in the JSX or to use memo() on a component or function. Anything else needs to execute the function/component to know if they should or not apply changes to the DOM. What you saved in the ""good"" example is the reference pointer to the values, you\'re not memoizing the execution of any code here, which kind of defeat the point of the memoization in your example.', 'But at the end of the day, it\'s not the end of the world. I know I\'m picking on a detail here, there are much worse things in the day to day code.

So basically our work is done here but you know if we create any software then it also need maintainance and database management etc. and this will be forever till that software exists. Now our work was to just deliver the product or the software the client asked for but if the client asks how to manage it further or asks us only to also manage it for long then what should we do in these both cases? Even if we just explain the client everything needs to be done in order to manage that software, the client still does not have a proper knowledge of it and maybe he/she will not be able to manage it properly and if they'll not manage it, the software will automatically start to throw any bugs or errors and they'll blame us for that. Now if the other option occurs that the client wants us to take care of that software further also for the long run but obviously we can't do that. So how can we handle such situations? How will that software and its database will be managed throughout its lifecycle? And what exactly should we tell the client to do in such situations?

I usually have a rule of thumb of not charging up to 3 small improvements -- just so we can have a great partnership and the client usually will remember that good faith.

After all, those things were not prototyped nor planned, so, adding them at a later stage will impact your costs.', ""That's my usual way of dealing with maintenance and new requests of features disguised as maintenance."", ""In terms of database usage and infrastructure, I usually try to eyeball the usage/consumption of services by talking to the client and seeing their expectations -- if they are searching for a freelance to create a platform that will have to deal with thousands of customers, you can't put infrastructure costs on your end, but, if you're dealing with a small project, that might be viable."", ""And lastly, in terms of how to talk with your clients, it's important to remember that they are non-technical people usually, so, try to abstract most of the complexity when talking to them, showing only the high-level overview and the costs each part requires.

Half of the react library is experimental features so you never know if suspense will resolve or you need to wait another 3 years until it becomes stable.

Starting to learn programming at 27, in addition to the aforementioned points, made me even more insecure.', 'By sharing all of this, I want to highlight another challenge that many juniors may encounter: shifting focus.', ""Now that I've overcome this mindset and found a bit of comfort and confidence in my path, I can see more clearly that I've wasted many days of my working hours being sad about the role I have and pondering a switch from front-end to back-end."", ""The lesson I've learned from this phase of my life is that by giving myself enough time and staying focused on my path, I can overcome my insecurities and find joy in my role again."", 'My message to new joiners: find what you love, stay focused, be patient.', ""Imposter syndrome is tough. üíô This is another area where community is very important. I also don't have a CS degree and started learning to program at 28. I have learned that knowing about both front-end and back-end is a boon even if I'm in a role currently focused on front-end. A lot of this perspective came from talking to senior developers when I was a junior."", ""Yes, the community really helps. It's definitely important to learn both sides as a software engineer, in my opinion, and creating a T-shaped skillset would really help, sometimes being crucial.

From the icy expanses of the Arctic to the scorching deserts of the Sahara, each species has developed unique characteristics and behaviors to ensure its survival. In this article, we will explore some of the fascinating adaptations that animals employ to thrive in their habitats.', 'Camouflage:\nOne of the most common and effective adaptations in the animal kingdom is camouflage. Many species have evolved colors and patterns that blend seamlessly with their surroundings, allowing them to evade predators or sneak up on prey. Examples include the snowshoe hare, whose white fur helps it blend into the snowy landscape, and the leaf-tailed gecko, which resembles a dead leaf when resting on a tree branch.', 'Mimicry:\nMimicry is another clever adaptation used by animals to deceive predators or prey. Some harmless species mimic the appearance of dangerous or distasteful ones to avoid being eaten, a phenomenon known as Batesian mimicry. For instance, the viceroy butterfly closely resembles the toxic monarch butterfly, deterring potential predators. Conversely, M√ºllerian mimicry occurs when multiple harmful species evolve similar warning signals, reinforcing the learned avoidance behavior of predators.', 'Echolocation:\nIn the darkness of caves or the depths of the ocean, animals like bats and dolphins rely on echolocation to navigate and locate prey. By emitting high-frequency sounds and interpreting the echoes that bounce back, these creatures can create detailed mental maps of their surroundings. This remarkable adaptation enables them to hunt with incredible precision, even in environments devoid of light.', 'Hibernation:\nTo survive harsh winters or periods of food scarcity, many animals enter a state of hibernation. During this time, their metabolism slows down, allowing them to conserve energy and survive on stored fat reserves. Bears, ground squirrels, and certain species of bats are just a few examples of animals that undergo hibernation. Some species even experience torpor, a less deep form of hibernation, to cope with temporary environmental challenges.', 'Migration:\nMigration is a widespread phenomenon observed in numerous animal species, particularly birds, mammals, fish, and insects. Whether fleeing from harsh weather conditions, following seasonal food sources, or seeking breeding grounds, migratory animals undertake long and often perilous journeys. The Arctic tern, for instance, travels an astonishing 70,900 kilometers (44,300 miles) on its annual migration route, from its breeding grounds in the Arctic to its wintering grounds in the Antarctic.', 'Conclusion:\nThe diversity of adaptations found in the animal kingdom is a testament to the ingenuity of evolution. From the smallest insects to the largest mammals, each species has developed unique strategies to overcome the challenges posed by their environments. By studying these adaptations, scientists gain valuable insights into the complexities of the natural world and the interconnectedness of all living beings. As we continue to explore and protect our planet, let us marvel at the wonders of animal adaptations and strive to preserve the rich tapestry of life on Earth.']"

You set 4 of them + plain CSS (not even in the first place for a reason I can't figure out) while in truth you only need CSS + Sass (SCSS) to provide optimized beautiful views those days, specially with flexbox.\nThen you stuck when having to code custom components... I find Tailwind highly disappointing on the other hand because you enforce yourself to learn the CSS api the wrong way (which makes you able to work with tailwind but terribly inefficient with SCSS) while flooding your HTML with seas of boilerplate.\nIf you've issues with SCSS is because a lack of good architecture and tailwind will not solve that and last but not least the amount of jobs listing tailwind is just ridiculous, last time I search for it in LinkedIn I could find only 1. It's all about community newbies hype so wdy bother anyway?"", ""I believe you don't find Tailwind as a requirement in job listings because it's so easy to learn it doesn't make sense to list.

Of course there are exceptions.

On the other hand and depending on the architecture and tooling used, you can end up loading the entire bootstrap (both CSS and JS) everywhere which makes your ""unused CSS"" grow in a blow.\nIt\'s so simple to bring styled components nowadays that usually those kits are a nonsense... I mean, yes, you can have something up and running fast but making your own is not so slow as well. The need of getting it running should be quite critical to walk that path because at the end you\'ll lose more time refactoring than what you could waste in the first hand doing it from scratch (or with some base).', ""I agree with you. I've only been in the field for two years but I've been doing css for well over 15 years and I think a lot of people rely too much on MUI/Tailwind/Bootstrap or whatever to do the work for them and then dont learn how to style it themselves.\nI hate helper classes that do one thing but it's actually 50 lines of css that you easily can do on your own with flexbox/grid in two lines."", 'lovely.', 'If react is not a framework then we can integrate it with some other framework like Laravel etc.. , right ?

I think pure frameworks offer a better overall technical approach, particularly when you can roll everything together. You end up with overall far better and more cohesive solutions.

From outside the application (like, from the wilds of the Internet) the primary key cannot be directly used for any purpose; it's a number or string with no semantic content. Such keys may not even be permanent, as a table in the application database may be updated or migrated in a way that generates new keys for old data. Because including primary keys in a cursor is necessary to disambiguate sort column values that are duplicated between rows (as with city names or people names), the actual value must used and not a hash because the database server does not have access to the hash: the primary key will be added implicitly as the least-significant sort key (after all user-requested or implicit application keys), so an ascending or descending column on a group of sorted-together duplicates is required for the cursor approach to work."", 'That was a great article!

It also ensures that each build incorporates the latest dependencies without bloating the final image size unnecessarily.', 'Keep in mind that the same can be achieved with multi-stage Docker builds though.', 'In multistage builds, you define multiple FROM instructions in your Dockerfile, each representing a different stage or phase of the build process. Typically, you start with a builder stage where you compile or build your application along with its dependencies. Once the build artifacts are ready, you can then copy only the necessary files from the builder stage into a smaller, final stage image. This final image is what you ultimately use for deployment.', 'For example, you first create a builder stage image. This stage is where you install dependencies, compile code, and generate any necessary artifacts.

In this stage, you start with a minimal base image (like alpine or scratch) and copy only the built artifacts from the builder stage. This ensures that the final image is as small and efficient as possible.', 'This approach not only reduces the size of your Docker image by excluding unnecessary build dependencies but also enhances security and build efficiency.

It doesn't work. Use a unique, complex password for each login that requires one...but understand that complex does not imply esoteric. Long phrases are currently considered the best strategy. If you have no reason to suspect a breach or significant possibility of a breach on an account, rotating the password does not decrease the chances of one. In fact, password rotation usually only leads to bad password strategies."", ""I could argue the same for keys, especially as they're even harder to crack than passwords, and far more likely to result in an unrecoverable account if you lose them."", ""That said, rotation policies may make more sense from a computer-to-computer perspective, if (and only if) there's any risk of exposure."", ""Enforce MFA everywhere - Google, GitHub, Cloud providers, VPNs, anywhere possible. If it's not optional, reconsider the system in use"", ""While I mostly agree with MFA, it is also not a guarantee of security ‚Äî see sim card attacks ‚Äî and it has its own hazards. If the service provides MFA, e.g. a code sent to a specific device, but no secure account recovery method, you may want to think twice. If you lose or destroy your phone (not that anyone has ever done that!) or it gets stolen, you're permanently locked out of any account that lacks recovery means. (PayPal is a prime example. No, they will not help. They'll go out of their way to FRUSTRATE helping, in fact.)"", '(One more note on that topic: there have been multiple security researchers who have warned that most consumer biometrics are less secure than passwords.

Consumer-focused biometrics should only be paired with a more secure authentication method, e.g. a key or password. Yes, I just said password.)', ""Be secure. But also be certain you aren't locking yourself out of Fort Knox permanently. It sucks at least as much as a breach."", ""I actually agree with 100% of your points and it makes me think whether I should sharpen my message;\nI'm discussing mostly software teams and companies (obviously not only but that's the target audience). With that in mind, I address both personal user passwords and authentication keys.\nTo answer your points directly:"", ""Password complexity - completely right, when I talk about complexity it's important to stress the importance of length rather than complexity.

That's another key point when talking about rotation."", 'MFA - again, correct, this is brought in the context of web login profiles for the 3rd party services team use daily.

In my experience, 99% of the teams need the push towards better security strategy rather than limiting the layers of protection they put on their processes.

We have four stages RAW store on S3 as a flat file, Bronze in Parquet on S3, Silver in Parquet on S3, and Gold in Parquet on S3.
